    # FIX 2: Grant permission to the file inside the Agent folder
    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      working-directory: ./Agent
      run: chmod +x gradlew

    # FIX 3: Run the 'gradlew' script inside the Agent folder
    # This ignores the system version (9.2.0) and downloads the correct old version.
